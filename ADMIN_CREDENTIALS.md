# Admin Login Credentials

## ⚠️ SECURE ADMIN CREDENTIALS

The admin login button has been removed from the login form for security. Admin access is now only available through the regular login form using hardcoded credentials.

2. Enter the admin credentials above
3. Click "Sign in"
4. You will be logged in as ADMIN with full access

## Security Notes:

- ✅ Admin button removed from UI (not easily accessible)
- ✅ Secure password with special characters
- ✅ Credentials are hardcoded in backend and frontend
- ✅ Admin can only login through regular login form
- ⚠️ Keep these credentials secure and private

## What Admin Can Do:

## Important:

**DO NOT** share these credentials publicly or commit them to public repositories. These are for your use only.
